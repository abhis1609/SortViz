# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a web application that showcases the inner workings of various sorting algorithms. It provides a visual representation of the algorithms' steps, allowing users to gain a better understanding of how each algorithm functions.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort

## Features

- Colored representation of each step:
  - Blue: Default color
  - Yellow: Elements being compared
  - Red: Elements identified as incorrectly positioned
  - Green: Elements in the correct position
- Controls for visualizations:
  - Speed control (with 5 speed levels)
  - Data size control
  - Data generation (randomly generate new data)
- Time and space complexity analysis of the algorithm being visualized.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/abhis1609/SortViz.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Select an algorithm from the menu and adjust visualization settings.
4. Click "Start" to begin the visualization.
